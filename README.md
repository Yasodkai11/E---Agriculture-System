🌾 E-Agriculture System for Sri Lanka

A digital platform that connects **farmers, buyers, and rice mill owners** directly — reducing middlemen, improving price transparency, and empowering Sri Lankan agriculture.



 📖 Overview

Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector faces severe challenges such as market inefficiencies, exploitation by intermediaries, and limited access to resources. Farmers receive only 32–45% of the final retail price, while consumers often face high prices due to artificial shortages.

This project proposes a mobile-first e-agriculture system, inspired by global models like India’s e-NAM, Kenya’s Twiga Foods, and China’s Rural Taobao, but designed specifically for the Sri Lankan context.



🎯 Objectives

 Provide farmers direct access to markets without intermediaries.
 Enable buyers to purchase fresh produce at fair prices.
 Integrate weather updates, price data, and farm management tools.
 Improve efficiency, transparency, and farmer income.



 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Firebase

 Authentication (role-based login: Farmer / Buyer / Rice Miller)
 Firestore (real-time database with offline support)
 Firebase Storage (media & image hosting)
 Firebase Cloud Functions (serverless operations)
 Firebase Messaging (push notifications)

Architecture & Patterns:

 Clean Architecture (separation of concerns)
 Provider (state management)
 Repository Pattern (data access abstraction)



 📱 Core Features

 👨‍🌾 For Farmers

 Create & manage product listings
 Track harvests, equipment, and farm records
 Sell directly to buyers
 View real-time weather & market updates

 🛒 For Buyers

 Browse & search agricultural products
 Place orders and track delivery
 View farmer profiles and ratings

 🌍 For All Users

  AI Chatbot for farming advice
  Financial tracking (income, expenses, profits)
  Push notifications for market updates & weather alerts



 🔬 Research Findings

  12.3% increase** in farmer selling prices
  18.7% growth** in farm revenue
  34% increase** in sales frequency
  67% reduction** in middlemen layers
  78% farmer adoption** in pilot testing



 ✅ System Testing

Unit Testing → models & business logic
Integration Testing → Firebase services
Widget Testing → Flutter UI components
Performance Testing → offline sync & scalability
User Acceptance Testing → validation with real farmers & buyers
